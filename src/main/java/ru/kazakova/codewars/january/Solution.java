     * Consider the following expansion:
     *
     * solve("3(ab)") = "ababab"     -- because "ab" repeats 3 times
     * solve("2(a3(b))") = "abbbabbb" -- because "a3(b)" == "abbb", which repeats twice.
     * Given a string, return the expansion of that string.
     *
     * Input will consist of only lowercase letters and numbers (1 to 9) in valid parenthesis.
     * There will be no letters or numbers after the last closing parenthesis.
     *
     * More examples in test cases.
     *
     * Good luck!
